# Permanent Upper Class

> The coordination layer for people who build things that compound. Assets, capital, and relationships — powered by AI, anchored on-chain.

The Permanent Upper Class is not a wealth bracket. It is a systems posture: your assets compound whether you're paying attention or not, your information pipeline learns from its own mistakes, your network creates value that feeds back to you.

## The thesis in brief

The Permanent Upper Class controls three things:
- **Assets** — things that appreciate or generate yield without active labor
- **Capital** — ability to deploy resources at the moment of maximum asymmetry
- **Relationships** — access to people building the future, not commenting on it

These form a flywheel. AI makes this loop executable by individuals at a scale that previously required institutions.
